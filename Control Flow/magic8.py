# fortune-telling and advice seeking. ðŸŽ±

# It's an oversized 8 ball with some of the following answers:

#    Yes - definitely.
#    It is decidedly so.
#    Without a doubt.
#    Reply hazy, try again.
#    Ask again later.
#    Better not tell you now.
#    My sources say no.
#    Outlook not so good.
#    Very doubtful.

# Create a magic8.py program that can respond to any Yes or No questions with a different answer
# each time it executes.
